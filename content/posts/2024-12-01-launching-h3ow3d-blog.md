Welcome to **h3ow3d** - my personal tech blog where I'll be sharing updates about my projects, lessons learned, and interesting technical challenges I encounter.

## Why h3ow3d?

I've always loved the format of h3ow3d in software and games. They're:

- **Clear and structured** - Easy to follow what changed
- **Version-based** - Track progress over time
- **Technical yet accessible** - Balance detail with readability

## What to Expect

I'll be posting about:

- Web development projects
- Cloud infrastructure experiments
- DevOps learnings
- Code optimization stories
- Architecture decisions

## Tech Stack

This blog itself is built with:

- **React** - For the UI
- **Vite** - Lightning fast development
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** - Static hosting with global CDN
- **React Markdown** - For content rendering

Stay tuned for more updates!
